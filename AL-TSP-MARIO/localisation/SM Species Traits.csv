species_beanie;Beanie;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_beanie_desc;This is a Beanie, the most common creature in the Beanbean Kingdom. Beanies are similar in appearence and abilities to Goombas, but strongly resemble legumes or pears instead of fungi. Indeed, where Goombas are fungal-based, Beanies are considered a plant-based being and, when no food is available, can harness photosynthesis to sustain themselves. Like Goombas, many Beanies can survive being stepped on and will exhibit identical issues with being stepped on as Goombas. Similarly to Goombas, Baenies, at some point, rebelled against the proper Beanbean Kingdom, but unlike Goombas, the Beanies were successfully subdued back under the Beanbean Crown. Now, roving Beanie bandits and raiders accost the countryside to attack travellers while more "civilized" Beanies govern as vassals and independent fiefdoms in the Beanish realm. Unlike Goombas, Beanies' tribal and familial structure have long been crushed and replaced with the modern ways of the greater Beanbean Kingdom.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_dinohattan;Dinohattanite;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_dinohattan_desc;This creature's ancestors hail from the forsaken dimension of Dinohattan. They breached the Portal in a desparate attempt to survive and expand, for their original homeland was a wasteland with few remaining settlements outside the titular capital, which is diseased and choked by the Great Fungus. With their world decaying, their homeland's military overthrew the dying monarchy and instilled a brutal junta under a "President Koopa", who has no relation to any Koopa of the Mushroom World. Despite being the cause of the Great Fungus, the President nonetheless promised green pastures and places to live, with the pollution and death of Dinohattan sealed behind them. \nAn abomination to all life of this dimension, the Dinohattanites are cold-blooded men of reptillian origin, their closest relative in the Mushroom World being the Rexes of Dinosaur Land and the Yoshis.

species_fuzzy_desc;Fuzzies are vampiric leeches that latch onto other lifeforms and consume small amounts of their blood, Vim, or life force for sustinence. Fuzzies cannot attack any form of Koopa if they are donning their shell. While indisputably sapient, the Fuzzy civilizations are primitive, tribal, and mob-based. Their leaders are called Big Fuzzies, named after the rarer super-sized Fuzzies, although most Fuzzy chieftans are not actually larger. Fuzzies are vermin by nature. Originally infesting treetops, jungles, and deep forests, they also swarm over artificial structures. When wiring, beams, and transportation platforms are erected to float in mid-air, Fuzzies will use their tree-climbing abilities to latch on them and start patrolling the wires, hoping unsuspecting prey will encounter them.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Genies require a vessel in order to retain a physical form, preferring metal containers like brazen oil lamps. In the Mushroom World, genies have the power to grant wishes and are most commonly known for escourting those lucky enough to find their lamps to the location of a Power Star. The most powerful genies, respectively, are the Mushroom Djinn and the antithetical Mushroom Jeanie. All genies use the traditional folk magic of the Mushroom World, known as the white Mushroom-Kadabra and the black Fungus Pocus. Bowser, in his first true invasion of the Mushroom Kingdom, would later employ Fungus Pocus to entomb the denizens of that land in blocks.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

The largest civilization of Gooms is in fact a pirate fleet under the command of Captain Syrup and her Black Sugar Gang. Gooms traditionally wield spears for ceremony and defense, but Gooms loyal to Captain Syrup are distinguished by their bandanas and use of three-pronged pitchforks.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick;Goomba;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick_desc;This is a Goomba. Goombas are among the most abundant creatures in the Mushroom World and are known for their distinctive eyebrows, fangs, and fungoid appeaarence. Goombas originally lived in peace with Toads in the Mushroom Kingdom, but the unification of Dark Land under King Bowser caused most of them to revolt and join the newfound enemy. Traditionally, Goombas were the working underclass of the Mushroom Kingdom under the middle, upper, and servile classes of Toads. Goombas, despite being as advanced as Toads, traditionally clinged to their tribal governance and deep, personal kinship with other Goombas. Goombas are extremely social creatures that form tight-knit bonds with family, friends, and brothers-at-arms. Among Koopas and Bowser's minions, Goombas are seen as the bedrock of loyalty to the Dark Land Crown and the ones most devoted to Bowser's cause. As the tribal governments of Goomba civilizations were diverse and had varying social conditions, no Goomba in the Koopa Troop will tell the same story as to why they rebelled.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_sarasaland_chick;Goombo;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_sarasaland_chick_desc;This is a Goombo. Goomboes are extremely closely related to Goombas, and are distinguished by their timidity, lack of eyebrows, smaller fangs, and wide, rounded caps.

During Tatanga's invasion of Sarasaland, Goomboes refused to side with either kingdom.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick_ghost;Goomboo;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick_ghost_desc;Goomboos are the spirits of long-departed Goombas with unfinished business.

species_chick_persimmon;Goombrat;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_chick_persimmon_desc;This is a Goombrat. Goombrats are distantly related to the Goombas but cannot breed with any other Goomba.

species_gromba_desc;Grombas are rock entities bearing extremely similar behaviors, appearences, and instincts to that of Goombas. They are native to the Pi'illo Islands. Most taxonomists and biologists believe that they have convergent evolution with Goombas and bare no relation or ancestor to Goombas. Unlike Galoombas, Goomboes, and Goombrats (as well as other Goomba varients), Goombas themselves do not consider them one of their own. For the purposes of this game, however, Grombas are classified with Goombas for coding and flavor purposes.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_men;Man;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x 
species_men_desc;Men, better known as Humans, are tall, prestigious, mammalian creatures with a propensity for rulership. Although the largest concentration of men is in New Donk City, as well as sizable locations in Diamond City and cultural enclaves of the Mushroom Kingdom (where the Mario Brothers grew up), the species has ruled the Mushroom Kingdom since the ascension of the adopted Princess Peach, and Sarasaland since Princess Daisy, and have ruled the seven constituent vassalages of the Mushroom Kingdom for far longer.\nAs the only significant mammalian population aside from Ukikis and Kongs, their unique traits hint at extradimensional origins: it is known that at least one other, bizzare dimension is dominated by humanity- a planet called "the earth" -and that this dimension has laws of physics and nature totally alien to reality. This world has been visted by Mario and Luigi before, but details about it are almost entirely mythical. Even the Mario Brothers can't really describe much about it aside from its exotic landmarks and bizzare physics.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

They are slower than normal Koopas and are incapable of removing their shell. Ishnail Koopas migrated from Dark Land eons ago after being rejected by the Koopas of Dark Land. The largest concentration of Ishnail Koopas in one location is in Rogueport. The Robbo Gang is the most prominant representation of Ishnail Koopas, for better or worse. Outside of the Odyssey Continents, Ishnail Koopas are among the last widespread practitioners of the indigineous, pre-Bowser Koopa paganism in the Mushroom World. Ishnail Koopas cannot breed with other Koopas.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

They are native to the deep, dark caverns of the Yoshi archipelago, but have been found in small amounts across the Mushroom World. Lantern Ghosts are flightless and cannot turn incorporal for extended periods of time, meaning most cannot pass walls beyond a certain thickness. Lantern Ghosts do not owe allegiance to any nation and are neutral entities, although some serve the King Boo. The largest specimins are called Big Lantern Ghosts and are generally much more cruel and mischevious than their normal counterparts.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_ghost_generic_desc;This creature is a spirit of a departed being, a servant of King Boo, or some other type of ghost or ectoplasmic, elemental, or spiritual being. Ghosts of this type are not some class of Boo or other distinct spiritual species. The most common spirits of this type are known as Mansion Ghosts, and they haunt abandoned buildings and Ghost Houses across the Mushroom World and even in outer space.

Existing within the bodies of non-human, non-fungal, organic beings, many of these microbes are sapient and some serve their host much like the non-sapient microbes found in the digestive tracts of men. Most notably, the bodies of Koopas and all other reptilian beings (such as dinosaurs and Kremlings) possess the benign Emoglobins- the most common, sapient microbe -and the rare, symbiotic Evoglobins, which are the naturally created, organic guardians of a reptile's immortal soul. Like all microbes regardless of sentience, they are threatened by pathogens like the infamous and deadly, sapient Viruses, and are protected by the host's immune system.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_yap;Warpman;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_yap_desc;This is a Warpman: all females are called Miss Warps and all males are called Mister Warps, even when they marry. They are never referred to as Warpmen outside of taxonomy and scientific classification of the species itself. Warpmen are a psychically powerful, interconnected race of cheery, living checkpoints. If a traveller comes into contact with a sleeping Warpman and wakes them (normally, this involves a Miss Warp and not a Mister Warp), they will activate and connect to psychic bonds with other Warpmen in the area. Jumping on top of them will allow the traveller to be launched into subspace and land in the presence of another Warpman within range. Warpmen are assigned numbers at birth, which represents the order in which travellers are teleported, from lowest to highest. These numbers need not be consequential. Warpmen are not actually men.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_money_bag_desc;This is a Money Bag, a fully sapient, living wallet. Money Bags are short-lived, physically weak creatures that produce coins in their body and horde them. They make expert administratiors, but their short lifespan makes their service fleeting. Despite their intelligence and thrift, Money Bags are defenseless and can only hop away when attacked. Due to their ability to literally produce gold in their bodies, they are largely an endangered species, protected by law in some areas and hunted by others. Everyone, even Mario, wants a piece of their loot.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

The most common form of mole in the Mushroom World is the Monty Mole and its varients. Most Monty Moles are tribal creatures that live in decentralized, familial clans, possessing no real advancement or modern concept of a nation-state. However, some moles abandon their more primitive civilizations and join the rest of society. When Monty Moles do this, they are known as Rocky Wrenches and are most commonly found in service to Bowser. Most mole tribes determine their leaders by sheer size: the largest Monty Moles, for instance, are called Mega Moles and wear sunglasses as a symbol of authority. Mega Moles can grow as tall as six feet and dig tunnels the size of caves, inhabitable by almost any creature.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_biting_flower;Piranha Plant;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_biting_flower_desc;This is a Piranha Plant. Piranha Plants are abundant, carniverous flowers- most of which are sapient -that possess immense biting force and an insatiable appetite. Most types of Piranha Plant must be rooted in either soil or a pipe to survive, and only resort to photosynthesis if they are starving. Piranha Plants that spit fire are called Venus Fire Traps, and other related varients (such as Munchers, the distantly related, mobile Ptooies and Stalking Piranha Plants, and the fearsome Lava Piranhas) infest every corner of the Mushroom World. One of the largest Piranha Plant jungles lies in Pipe World, one of the constituent, vassal kingdoms of the Mushroom Kingdom. Piranha Plants and their related species can stand as small as one foot to multiple stories tall. In tropical areas, most Piranha Plants form tribes under the control of a Lava Piranha, while temperate Piranha Plants either form local clans or serve Petey Piranha. Some Piranha Plants and their subspecies are even capable of locomotion. Locomotive Piranha Plants are called Stalking Piranha Plants unless they are a Ptooie.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Pixls were created to serve, but in around Year -85, the first Pixl led a rebellion that slaughtered most of the Ancients. This Pixl Revolt lead to the creation of the Tribe of Darkness, which stole the Dark Prognosticus with the intent of ensuring it would never be used again, under any circumstance.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_plant_generic;Plant;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_plant_generic_desc;This is a plant, and it may not neccesarily be sapient.

species_pokey_desc;This is a Pokey. Pokeys are sapient cacti comprised of multiple spiked segments. Like most plants, sapient or otherwise, Pokeys "feed" by photosynthesis but, despite their rigid cell walls, are fully capable of locomotion. They boast extraordinary longevity and resistance to attacks due to their segmented nature. When an individual segment is severed, a Pokey's overall body is unharmed, and the segment will always grow back.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Puffers are considered a delicacy by Yoshis everywhere.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_raven;Raven;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_raven_desc;This is a Raven. Ravens are large, slow moving birds native to the Yoshi Island archipelago and the distant Lavalava Island. They possess the remarkable ability to latch onto any surface, even upside down, and remain firmly stuck to it, preventing them from falling off. All Ravens speak a common language, and their ambassadors and rulers are usually the only bilingual members of a Raven clan. Ravens are tribal in nature, and are ruled by gargantuan-sized members of their species, all of which are dubbed "Raphaels", regardless of gender. For Ravens, "Raphael" is both a name and a title. Ravens, for the most part, are flightless, but they can flap their wings for short spurts to escape predators. Raphaels, however, are capable of full airborne flight by flapping their feet.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Where Neurons dwell in the Great Neuron Jungle and other rainforest climates on the Yoshi Islands, Sea Cacti are the among the largest creatures in the burgeoning coral reefs and lakes of the region. Despite being lined with spikes, Sea Cacti pose no threat unless they are touched- touching them without their permission will always cause HP damage, as they can secrete poison through their spikes -and do not actively attack any other creatures, though they are not hesitant to defend themselves and fellow Neurons if needed. Sea Cacti can live in both fresh and salt water.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Their faces and physical features are hidden by their robes, and they possess glowing eyes. Most Shamans employ themselves in service as clergy in Astrotheology and lunar worship, or take up secular jobs as fortune tellers, diviners, oracles, and profits. Some hostile bands of Shaman sorcerers exist and roam the countryside wreaking havoc, but for the most part, Shamans are docile and focused on the spiritual realm.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_shark_generic;Shark;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_shark_generic_desc;A shark is a fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, gill slits on the sides of the head, and prehensile, pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are closely related to Manta Rays and other cartilaginous creatures in the seas of the Mushroom World. Unlike sharks on the extradimensional "earth", the pectoral fins of real sharks are tipped by dextrous hands with opposable thumbs. A shark normally bends his pectoral fins close to his torso to swim, and wears boxing gloves to render itself more hydrodynamic. Sharks attack with speed and grace, using their sharp skin to draw blood, then using their fists to pummel them until they are too weak to resist consumption. Alternately, they simply catch the creature with their hands and consume it with their fierce teeth.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_shroob;Shroob;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_shroob_desc;This is a Shroob, an extraterrestrial, fungoid being that harvests the life force of other fungoid creatures for the purpose of powering their infrastructure, fleet of ships, and every day life.

Known for their spectacular cruelty- even to themselves -the Shroobs extract and engineer the Vim of other fungoids (with Toad Vim being the most potent) using bio-engineered trees to be used as fuel. In addition to extracting Vim, they can also use their energy weapons to transform any other living being into a purple, immobile Shroob Mushroom: this is called being "Shroobified". After their invasion was fended off, it was realized that Shroob rot, Shroob Mushrooms, and toadwood can all be killed or reverted by using the tears of infant men.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_shy_guy;Shy Guy;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_shy_guy_desc;This is a Shy Guy, also known as a Shyguy. Shy Guys are small, masked creatures that hide their faces behind masks in modesty. As their name suggests, shyness is their defining trait and, consequently, most (but not all) types of Shy Guy are bashful and reluctant to interact with creatures unlike them. Most Shy Guys live in ancient, ritualistic tribal structures with defined rulers and roles, making their "states" more developed than many other "primitive" races. However, some Shy Guys have since modernized and evolved their society: the largest anti-tribal, contemporary government of Shy Guys is a stratocracy under the command of the General Guy. It is unknown what, if anything, is behind a Shy Guy's mask, but testimonies from the few who have seen the mask slip indicate that whatever it is, is horrific.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_true_spike_desc;This is a Spike Koopa. Spike Koopas are stout, round Koopas that cannot withdraw into or take off their shells. Spikes are all named for their use of maces. The most common Spike attack is to literally regurgitate a previously swallowed mace and throw it. Spikes that do not employ this tactic, but instead wield maces as conventional weapons, are called Clubbas. The largest known Spike is Tubba Blubba. If done with the aid of powerful magic, a Spike can transfer its soul into its heart and remove it, rendering its former vessel invincible.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_star_generic_desc;Behold the Star. To be a Star is to be divinity incarnate, a living god, and not to be confused with the burning ball of gas that gives off heat and light. In the Mushroom World, Stars wield the power to grant wishes, break spells and curses, unlock cursed doors, and protect the innocent.\n The main groups of Stars are the Star Spirits and Star Kids, the Star Sprites, the Power Stars, and the Starmen. The Star Spirits comprise the chief spot in the pantheon of Astrotheology and wield the Star Rod. Star Kids and Star Sprites are the servants of Star Haven and the Star Road. Power Stars wield unimaginable power to break curses, defeat Bowser at his peak, and even create life and galaxies. Power Stars are born as Lumas, where they are protected by Rosalina until they mature. The greatest and largest Power Stars are called Grand Stars. Starmen grant temporary invincibility to whoever picks them up.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_strolling_stu;Strolling Stu;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_strolling_stu_desc;This character is a Strolling Stu, a docile, quiet creature native to Isle Delfino. Biologists believe they split off from Galoombas millions of years ago, when they showed up on the isolated archipelagos of Isle Delfino. Strolling Stus are the only descendant of primordial Goombas that possess a nose, which covers their mouth. A "victim" of Insular Tameness, the lack of any natural predators (even after they, the Piantas, and Nokis reached sapience) caused them to shed their fangs and evolve into pacifistic, tolerant beings. Strolling Stus, like Goombas, can be flattened or even killed by  stomping. Like Goombas, Strolling Stus come in various flavors, can defend themselves better in numbers(like stacking on top of each other), and they can rarely have the capacity for flight. Strolling Stus cannot naturally reproduce with any known Goomba. Despite similar appearences, Strolling Stus have no relation to Burts and do not behave like Burts at all.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_sworm_desc;This is a Sworm. Sworms are black, burrowing, worm-like creatures bearing large eyes and larger mouths. Sworms are native to the Beanbean Kingdom and are abundant throughout the Beanish realm, but are especially abundant in the Beanbean Fields near the Beanish capital. Like traditional worms, Sworms traditionally live underground and primarily consume dirt. The elusive, subterranean nature of the Sworm means information on any possible civilization is scarce, if it exists at all.

species_raccoon_dog;Raccoon Dog;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_raccoon_dog;This is a Tanooki, a subspecies of an Oriental, canid animal called the "raccoon dog". Raccoon dogs are closely related to foxes and exhibit many behaviors akin to them and are not, in fact, related to actual raccoons. Unlike their primitive "earth" counterparts, real raccoon dogs possess extraordinary powers and beauty. Raccoon dogs are the primary producers of Tanooki Suits, which give their wearer the ability of flight and temporary transformation into an invincible statue. Although the connection between raccoon dogs and Tanooki suits are undisputed, the debate on whether or not Super Leaf power-ups give Tanooki tails or actual raccoon tails to their wearer is a subject of fierce debate.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_tanoomba;Tanoomba;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_tanoomba_desc;This is a Tanoomba. Tanoombas are a powerful varient of Goomba capable of flight and mimicry, taking the form and abilities of other creatures. Their mimicry is not perfect, however, as they will always retain either the leaf-like growth on their faces or their raccoon dog features. Tanoombas function, in essence, as Goombas permanently empowered by a Tanooki Suit and bare raccoon dog, not actual raccoon, tails. They behave far more like raccoon dogs than normal Goombas, attacking with their tails and powers instead of head bonking, stacking, or walking. Like raccoon dogs, Tanoombas love to climb and are inherently mischevious and sly. Like Goombas, they can be defeated by being stepped on.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_blue_pink_butterfly;Tee-hee Butterfly;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_blue_pink_butterfly_desc;Tee-hee Butterflies are insect creature capable of flight and lacking any limbs, with the remarkably ability to alter their bodily composition on the fly. Native to the Yoshi Island archipelago, a Tee-hee Butterfly will constantly shift its colors from blue to pink every thirty seconds or so. When a Tee-hee Butterfly is blue, it secretes poison and becomes inedible and bitter. When a Tee-hee Butterfly is pink, it immediately detoxifies and becomes delicious. Pink Tee-hee Butterflies are a delicacy across the Mushroom World. Tee-hee Butterflies are considered delicacies because of the extreme difficulty it is to harvest one at the right color. If a Tee-hee Butterfly is shot, jumped on, or struck, it will turn blue in defense and remain that way in death. However, for example, if a Tee-hee Butterfly is consumed alive or left to die a natural death, it will remain in the state it was when its life functions ceased. As such, Yoshis are contracted to consume pink Tee-hee Butterflies and then sell the eggs they were processed into in order to enjoy the spectacular flavors locked within. However, the rarest and most sought-after delicacy from this creature is the direct consumption of a cooked, pink Tee-hee Butterfly.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Like all fungal-based creatures, Toads do not bleed, but rather, possess a solid life force in cells' chitin called Vim. Toads Like all fungal creatures, Toads are capable of fluid locamotion and movement. Toads are one of the most abundant species in the Mushroom World, with numbers similar to Goombas and Koopa Troopas. Almost all Toads dress in the same general outfit, differing colors. Some Toads are capable of sprouting hair from their fruiting bodies and not every Toad is cowardly. The fearsome Treasure Trackers, who plunder, rob, and kill wherever their greed takes them, all consist entirely of uncharacteristically ambitious, vicious Toads. A Toad was also the savior of the Peaceful Woods when Wario attempted his annexation of the region.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_toady;Toady;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_toady_desc;This is a Toady. Toadies are flighted, cloaked Koopas that perform elite and honor guard functions for Bowser. Historically, Toadies answer primarily to Kammy and Kamek and were tasked with the capture of the escaped Baby Mario and the other Star Children during Bowser's infancy. Toadies are deeply mystical and spiritualistic, performing most religious and clergy functions in both Bowser's cult of personality and traditional Koopa Paganism alongside Magikoopas. Where Magikoopas use brooms and occult forces to fly, Toadies use creaky, antiquated propellor propulsion- unchanged for generations -to keep them aloft, making their attacks and abductions highly conspicuous. Unlike Magikoopas, which are Koopa Troopas with special training in sorcery, Toadies are classified as a distinct species for the purposes of the game, which can fully breed with normal Koopas.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Ukikis are a type of monkey that are closely related in both genetics and intelligence to the Kong apes and Kong monkeys, although they cannot breed with one-another. Ukikis are found across the Mushroom World in sparse amounts, but they are most abundant on the Yoshi Island archipelago and other tropical areas. The "home base" of Ukiki civilization, the infrastructure and scope of which is buried in the darkest jungles, is the aptly named "Monkey World" in said archipelago.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_vampire_generic;Vampire;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
species_vampire_generic_desc;A Vampire is a type of corpse that becomes reanimated and leaves its lair (or grave) at night to feed on the blood of the living. Vampires require either blood, tomato and vegetable juices, red coloring, or similar proteins to blood to sustain themselves and will constantly seek these out. "Vegetarian" vampires that refuse blood and go for coloring or juice are monumentally weaker, possess far less power, and are vastly easier to kill than bloodthirsty vampires. However, all vampires are nonetheless extremely powerful and difficult to kill, attacking with remarkable grace and subtlety that leave creatures dead before they know they are attacked. Vampires are biologically immortal, but can be killed by sunlight, stakes, Starmen, and other star-based or light-based abilities and powers. They are severely allergic to garlic and cannot withstand water that was previously used in either a religious ceremony or offered to (and accepted by) the Star Spirits or other deified creatures. A vampire cannot enter a building it does not own or hold a legal stake in unless it is first invited inside. Vampires cannot make new vampires unless a living creature grants its consent to be "turned". To kill a vampire, one must either expose it to sunlight or drive a wooden stake through its heart. (If the creature's species did not have a heart in life, a stake through the head works instead.) Known as the "gentleman's monster", vampires are customarily bound by an ancient series of impeccable manners and boast a proud heritage that make them seem arrogant, snobbish, and pompous to their monster and undead peers. A distinct beauty and grace has always been associated with and displayed vampires in the Mushroom World, and indeed, "vampire" also refers to a beautiful female- particularly a vampiric female -that deceives and then "feeds" on the creature it has seduced or tricked. A vampire is bound by honor and goodwill to its friends, and the fiercest enemy of its foes.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

species_the_yoshmeister_desc;This is a Yoshi. Yoshis are among the most common dinosaurs in the Mushroom World, originating from the Yoshi Island archipelago and spreading to the rest of the Mushroom World. Highly adaptable and ravenous, they will eat anything and everything they can latch onto their tongues. Most Yoshis are among the greatest and most loyal servants in the Mushroom World and, when alone, form tribal clans with simple familial ties and community-based hatchling rearing. All Yoshis are paternal and nurturing to any infant or juvenile creature- except Bowser Koopas -and are responsible for saving Mario and Luigi's lives. Without Yoshis, there would be no Mario Brothers. Yoshis are deeply connected with the natural world and most Yoshis worship the Super Happy Tree, located in the heart of the main Yoshi Island, in their numerous sacred groves.

species_yux_desc;This is a Yux. Yuxen are lifeforms created entirely from scratch, using artificial means, to serve as sentries and powerful guardians for the X-Naut horde. Capable of flight and spectacular feats of psychic power, Yuxen are literally biological weapons made to serve martial purposes. After the X-Nauts fell and their purpose was removed, the Yuxen set out on their own to try and be accepted by the rest of the Mushroom World. A Yux protects itself by spawning a triangular Mini-Yux, four of which render the Yux totally invincible to every known attack to ever exist, even the forces of the Star Rod and the Peach Beam! Three types of Yuxen exist: the normal, green Yux, the elite, grey Z-Yuxen that protect extraterrestrial and space operations, and the mighty X-Yux, a red Yux capable of easily taking on Bowser or even Mario himself. Preferring to be called a "Cross Yux", the X-Yuxen are the undisputed leaders of all known Yuxen. Yuxen are extremely intelligent and remarkably friendly, but they will obey any order from their superior officers unless their officers are deposed or they themselves die.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
