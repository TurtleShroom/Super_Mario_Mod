# RELIGIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS #
##############################
seven_stars;Astrotheology;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
seven_stars_DESC;Astrotheology is a diverse, expansive religion that proclaims the seven benevolent Star Spirits as the supreme masters of the universe. The Star Spirits reside in the mortal coil, in a far-off place called Star Haven, that can only be reached over the Star Road, starting from Shooting Star Summit. Focused deeply on making wishes and requests to the Star Spirits, the Star Spirits can only use the full scope of their power and divinity when in possession of the Star Rod, a divine instrument that can make any wish they so choose come true. Nearly all other sentient stellar lifeforms are derived from or serve the Star Spirits, and include, in order of importance, the Grand Stars, Power Stars, Lumas (infant Power Stars), and the Star Kids. In addition to the Star Spirits and other stars, there is a host of angel-esque creatures that are revered or worshipped, such as Geno, the guardian of the Star Road, the Star Sprites, who sealed the Dark Star, and Rosalina, who shelters Lumas until they mature into Power Stars.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
rosalina_worship;Rosalina Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
rosalina_worship_DESC;This religion is centered around Rosalina, the immortal human protector of baby Power Stars, called Lumas. A servant of the Star Spirits on the same seniority as Geno and the Star Sprites, Rosalina oversees, shelters, and guards all Lumas, Power Stars, and Grand Stars. In contrast to mainstream Astrotheology, which acknowledges Rosalina as an "archangel" of sorts under the Star Spirits, Rosalina worshippers consider Rosalina to be equal to, or superior to, the Star Spirits and even the Star Rod.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
kong_religion;Crystal Coconut;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
kong_religion_DESC;The worship of the Crystal Coconut, the prophetic idol of the Kongs. Brought to the Tropical Archipelago of Kongo Bongo by the Kremling pirate Kaptain Skurvy, the Crystal Coconut has been the source of conflict on the island for centuries. Its prophetic power, and seemingly alien intelligence being a great boon for those who hold it. Traditions amongst the Kongs who worship the Crystal Coconut are the collection of banana hordes as a show of prosperity, and the changing of one's name at certain points of one's life, such as important life-changing crossroads, or the beginning of one's golden years.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
twilight_towner_reformed;Twilight;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
twilight_towner_reformed_DESC;The reformed religion of the people of Twilight Town is organized into a traditional church structure, and centred around the worship of the source of all life, the Moon, at the Creepy Steeple.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
###Defining features in-game:\n§Y*§! The Twilit Pope may excommunicate Twilight Towner faithful \n§Y*§! The Twilit Pope may grant divorces \n§Y*§! The Twilit Pope may grant claims and sanction invasions \n§Y*§! Secular lords may not rule directly over temple holdings \n§Y*§! Only males may be priests \n§Y*§!

# Formist/Temple of Form description was primarily written by Empoleon Blownaparte with help from Iustinius, and religion concept and mechanics are his work
temple_of_form;Temple of Form;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
temple_of_form_DESC;The Temple of Form is the epicenter, spiritual nexus, and core of Formist belief, located on the outskirts of Diamond City. It is the origin and site of pilgrimage for all Formists. Grouped with absurdism and the Prophecy of Grey in thought, Formists believe life to be meaningless and absurd from the surface to the core, and that a life focusing on "important" things, like glory and legacy, is a life wasted. To Formists, to live in the moment is to be fulfilled for eternity, and to strive for one's own ideals is the greatest ideal of all. The Formists worship an infinite number of entities known as "The Forms", who are the embodiments of mundanity and individually represent lifestyles, situations, and goals. The leader of the Forms is an entity known as the Narrator, who is said to speak aloud the events of all lives as they happen.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
power_moon_worship;Power Moon Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
power_moon_worship_DESC;Contrasted with the Power Stars are the weaker, but more common, Power Moons. They are a source of energy for many applications, divine and mundane, throughout the Odyssey continents, and, like Power Stars, are connected to both Rosalina and the Star Spirits. This religion reveres the Moon, primarily as a semi-sentient Guardian Entity, bringer of life, and source of their main resource, and does not reject the pantheon of Astrotheology. Traditions in Power Moon Worship include an emphasis on Love as the most powerful emotion, and the Odyssey, a pilgrimage that begins from the northwest in the moon-blessed lands of Cap Kingdom to the fallen spires of the Ruined Kingdom, with modern technological advances making a trip to the Moon itself the proper end of the prilgrimage.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
beanstar_faith;Beanstar;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
beanstar_faith_DESC;The Beanstar is a minor Star Spirit and the protector of the Beanbean Kingdom. Independent from the Star Rod, the Beanstar has the capacity to grant all wishes made unto it without discretion or discrimination to that wish's intent. Due to this potential for abuse, the Beanstar rests in a deep sleep at the behest of the Star Sprites, sealed somewhere in the Beanbean Kingdom. Only the voice of someone who is truly pure of heart can awaken the Beanstar and make their wish.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan;Dryite Pagan;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan_DESC;Dryite Paganism refers to the ancient religion of the Dry Dry Kingdom and its inhabitants before the Criminals' Rebellion against King Mousta, which brought that realm to its end. It acknowledges the pantheon of Astrotheology but places emphasis in the divinity of the sun itself. It also reveres the mystical genies of the world, seeing them as messengers, escourts, and righteous beings.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan_reformed;Dry Dry Paganism;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
dryite_pagan_reformed_DESC;At last, the Dryite Pagans once again control enough of Dry Dry Desert to become an international powerhouse! The reformed Dryite Pagan faith has organized its pantheon and settled theological disputes between itself and Astrotheology on the roles and purpose of the Star Spirits. The manuscripts salvaged from the Dry Dry Ruins and other archeological sites have at last been compiled into one universal canon, and an organized liturgy and priesthood now guards the truths buried beneath the sands.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
mario_party_genies_worship;Djinn Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
mario_party_genies_worship_desc;After the reformation and reorganization of Dry Dry Paganism, some dissident sects broke away after the standardization of worship of the Star Spirits and reconciliation with Astrotheology. These sects primarily declare the divinity and supremacy of the Mushroom Djinn's and other genies' wish-granting capacity to the power of the Star Rod, while seeing the Mushroom Jeanie as a force of black magic.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
piracy;Piracy;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
piracy_DESC;Pirates have but one god, and that is plunder. \nA pirate holds no allegiance to a Crown or star, has no servitude except to his own ambition, honors no virtues except towards his crew, and never holds back on seizing the booty. For a pirate, there are two types of things in the world: that which pirates have, and that which pirates have yet to take.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
al_koopone;Organized Crime;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
al_koopone_DESC;In the cruel streets of Crime Land, behind closed blinds in Delfinite verandas at sunset, or roaming the streets of Rogueport, there exists another world that is a law unto itself. Gilded in silver duct tape, the mafias, gangs, and thief guilds of the Mushroom World honor the Koopomerta- the Oath of Silence -and cooperate as one to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Led by legends like the great Al Koopone of Crime Land (a rare example of a Bowser Koopa unrelated to Bowser himself) and the bloodthirsty Don Pianta of Rogueport and Isle Delfino, such sporadic gangs compete for glory, wealth, and enrichment. Membership is voluntary and anyone may leave the Family without worry, but may the Stars have mercy on anyone who betrays the trust and silence of "this thing of ours" when they are gone.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
movie_cult;Portal Guardians;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
movie_cult_DESC;Once upon a time, a great Meteorite struck the earth- long theorized to be the ancestral home world of men like the Mario Brothers and the New Donkers. This massive destruction of that planet, so the abominations claim, created a third dimension where non-sentient dinosaurs gradually came to mirror the sentient dinosaurs of Dinosaur Land, except that they took the appearence of man. That world was ransacked and polluted in a search for resources, eventually depopulating most of itself aside from the global capital. The ruler of the planet, King Reznor, was overthrown by the military under the leadership of the corrupt President Koopa (unrelated to Bowser Koopa), who promised the dinosaur men a new world on the other side./nThis monastic religion once worshipped the psychic energy created by the Meteorite, protecting it and its inhabitants by secretly controlling the Crown. However, the rise of President Koopa's junta corrupted the faith as the clergy was purged and staffed with loyalists. Now, it is a grotesque mockery of itself: a tool to accomplish President Koopa's will and nothing else.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
## Generic witchcraft worship, as conceived by Iustinius and Empoleon Blownaparte ##
witchcraft;Witchcraft;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
witchcraft_DESC;An umbrella term for those who dabble in the art of black magic, witches are those who dive deep into things considered profane. From Tarot Readings and speaking to the dead to summoning demons and hexing their foes, witches are known for their control over things deemed unholy by most faiths. One's reasoning for a witch's descent into darkness can range from the benign belief that the divines approve of braving the profane, to the truly depraved, such as a dark tyrant solidifying his rule through dark spells and devilish sacrements, as well as everything in between. Cultures steeped in Witchcraft tend to forgo traditional morality for ideals such as power over others and knowledge of the world's deepest secrets. Those who tread this dark path take pride in being feared by those they claim do not understand them.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
## This religion was conceived by Iustinius and Empoleon Blownaparte, among others, by huge popular demand ##
pianta_imperialism;Unconquerable Sun;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
pianta_imperialism_desc;The Cult of the Unconquerable Sun is a militarized version of the traditional Shine Sprite worship of Isle Delfino and its surrounding archipelago. It states that the Delfinite culture must be spread to every corner of the world, that the sun might shine eternally over its chosen people. As told in the Book of the Dawn, the peoples of the Delfinite archipelago were once as peaceful as could be, until the first ruler of the ancient Empire of the Sun united the archipelago islands. That is when Auroreus, the monotheistic master of the Cosmos, made himself known to him, believing the emperor would be the first of many to carry out his will and told him to write down everything he had to say, such as how he is the one who gave the Piantas the Shine Sprites, that all of the stars, including the sun and the Star Spirits, are his eyes keeping watch over ongoing events, and that the world must be controlled by them in order to bring the Light of the Sun, and his words, to everyone and keep it that way forever.\n However, detractors say that Auroreus and this so-called ancient empire are completely made up, as history has never recorded a full unification of the entire Delfino archipelago. They claim this "religion" exists to legitimize expansionist ambitions and to spread that imperialist fervor into the mindset of all of the Piantas.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
## This religion was conceived by Empoleon Blownaparte and Iustinius as a filler for non-aligned Koopas that did not worship Bowser or Astrotheology ##
koopa_pagan;World Turtle;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
koopa_pagan_desc;The traditional faith of the ancient Koopa races is extinct in its own homelands since the rise of the Koopa dynasty and their own invented faith, but it still exists in small pockets throughout the world. Koopa Paganism varies due to the wide berth of Koopa homelands, from the Bowsers of the Darklands to the ancient Shellcreepers of the Odyssey continents. Things shared by all Koopa pagans include: the posthumous worship of an entity known as the "World Turtle", a giant Koopa-like being whose corpse is now literally the Mushroom World, the idea that this World Turtle's soul will one day incarnate as a saviour-figure for the Koopas, and ancestor veneration. Pagan Koopas believe all life to have evolved from the bacteria within the World Turtle's body.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
koopa_pagan_reformed;Church of the World Turtle;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
koopa_pagan_reformed_desc;From the brink of extinction, the faith of the World Turtle rises from the ashes to win the hearts, minds, and souls of Koopas everywhere! The reformed Church of the World Turtle contains organized liturgies and authenticated sacred texts compiled from the earliest known sources into one canon. Established clergy and temple worship now replaces the hilltop shrines and diviners of old. The righteous soul that managed to rescue the faith from death and organize its believers is considered the Savior and World Turtle incarneate and is worshipped by all the faithful.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

goomba_pagan;Goomba Tribalism;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
goomba_pagan_desc;Goombas do not have a proper traditional faith beyond the idea of a progenitor, creator-god entity known as "The Almighty Goomba", but instead they tend to fall under the teachings of whatever ruler they currently have, and many Goomba traditionalists syncretize their deity to be the greatest servant of the local deity proper. This syncretized deity is always strong and steadfast in service, whether to the Stars, the World Turtle, Aster, the Forms, or so on. Goombas have a tribalistic, highly complex social structure based around family units and a focus on community.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
goomba_pagan_reformed;Universal Goomba Church;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
goomba_pagan_reformed_desc;Merely minions no more, the Goombas have nominally united under a single banner! Their complex social structure has evolved a semi-religious belief that all Goombas are one family under one race-wide Patriarch or Matriarch, second only to the Almighty Goomba, benevolent master of all and progenitor of life.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

dark_prognosticus;Prophecy of Darkness;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;X
dark_prognosticus_desc;The Followers of the Dark Prophecy, as foretold by the Dark Prognosticus. Said to be descended from the ancient and near-extinct Tribe of Darkness, the Dark Prophecy fortells the end of creation itself. The modern followers of the Dark Prophecy seek to invade all worlds simultaneously with the intent of destroying this cruel reality and starting it over again, with followers of the Dark Prophecy supposedly being given the chance to rule this new universal order as they see fit.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;X
light_prognosticus;Prophecy of Light;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;X
light_prognosticus_desc;The Followers of the Light Prophecy, as foretold by the Light Prognosticus. The Prophecy of Light was made by the Four Sages as a counteraction to the False Prophets of the Tribe of Darkness. They revere the Tribe of Ancients, and the Destined Heroes of their prophecy. ;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;X
grey_prognosticus;Prophecy of Grey;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;X
grey_prognosticus_desc;Descendents of the Tribe of Darkness who migrated to Flopside long ago, those who follow the Prophecy of Grey reject both the unending nihilism of the Prophecy of Darkness, and the hopeless naivety of the Prophecy of Light, instead teaching that both are technically correct and technically wrong. The Followers of Grey believe that one is to be responsible for one's own actions, and that the Prophecies are merely how the end may play out. They otherwise share the belief that once the world ends, they and their Prognostic cousins will oversee the new worlds made.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;X
thunder_dragon;Thunder Dragon Worship;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
thunder_dragon_desc;Once, long ago, the Thunder Empire worshipped a godlike entity known as the Great Thunder Dragon. This terrifying beast gave reluctant boons to the mortals in exchange for gold and worship, and it was thanks to the Great Thunder Dragon that the Empire grew so powerful. As was mortal nature, however, the Thunderites grew greedy, and began to believe in their hubris that they could conquer and control their so-called God. Today, the Great Thunder Dragon and its kin rule the ruins of the Thunder Empire, and those mortals who thrive in the dark wastes have learned never to cross them...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
lunar_goddess_worship;Lunar Traditionalism;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
lunar_goddess_worship_desc;Over the centuries, especially in recent decades, the power of religion on the Odyssey continents has drastically faded, with old traditions being either forgotten, or just co-opted by secular institutions, such as the Odyssey, or the various religious relics being turned from sacred objects to tourist traps. With the realms of the Odyssey continents secularizing and ending state endorsement of religion, more ancient devotion has faded. Lunar shamans no longer wield political clout or influence and shrine attendance is down. The syncretism with Astrotheology has also co-opted mainstream lunar worship, with the idea that the stars exceed the moon being almost universally acknowledged.\n In some parts of the world, however, there is an older form of the faith unchanged by foreign influence. This Traditionalist form of Power Moon Worship venerates not the moon itself, but a nameless Moon Goddess, who is worshipped as a Goddess of Love, and supposedly gave the Power Moons to the people of the continents. Some traditionalists syncretise this Goddess with the Angel Rosalina, but most consider any God besides the Moon Goddess to be inferior. suppressed due to being considered too superstitious, such as the belief in their old Goddess,;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

###bowser_religion;Bowser Ethics;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x###
###bowser_religion_desc;There was once a humble child of one of the slightly more prosperous Dark Land tribes, his name once as unnoticeable as they come, the son of a thief with blood of dishonorable men, who saw the suffering of his people and their brethren races and believed only he could rip the Darklands out of savagery. He succeeded. The Great King Koopa, Bowser, united the Darklands under his rule and carried it on his back into prosperity and glory. At the earliest peak of his rule, he used his peoples' traditional faith to legitimize his rule and claimed himself a prophet, codifying religious doctrines that he believed would help in his goal of a prosperous Darkland. Bowser Ethics believe in simultaneously staying in one's place and becoming the greatest man that place has ever seen. A truly pious Bowser Ethicist is never satisfied with "Good Enough" and will not stop until he revolutionizes his or her field.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x###

STAT_PIETY_BANANAS;Bananas;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_BANANAS;Bananas Hoarded Per Month;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_BANANAS;It is the duty of every Kong and every believer in the Crystal Coconut to amass a Banana Hoard, both for the sustinence of them and their loved ones, as well as for being perceived as holy and upright. The more bananas one has harvested or seized, the more he is seen as favored in the omnipresent eyes of the Crystal Cocunut. Like Prestige, the size of one's Banana Hoard is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_INNER_PEACE;Inner Peace;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_INNER_PEACE;Many religions do not hold any concept of 'piety', instead holding one's own contentedness and joy in life as all that matters in a faithful's life. Like Prestige, Inner Peace is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_DESC_VIM;Taking the place of blood in reptillian and mammalian creatures, Vim is the life force of fungal-based creatures in the Mushroom World, such as Goombas, Galoombas, and most powerfully, in Toads. Unlike blood, Vim is solid- no fungal creature bleeds when cut -and found within the chitin of their fungal cells. Vim only turns liquid when extracted and processed. Unlike like real world fungi, some fungal-derived creatures in the Mushroom World have a heart, although the function of it may not be as a pump. In addition to keeping fungal-based creatures alive, Vim is also a potent source for renewable energy if one knows the genetic bio-engineering to remove and proces it. \n All mechanisms and forms of internal combustion and propellant in Shroob machinery depend on Vim to function. (It also serves as a "delicious" drink for the Shroobs.) The acquisition of Vim is performed using bio-engineered trees known as toadwood: fungal creatures are forcibly lodged in the machine and slowly bled dry of their Vim, before withering into husks and, upon death, are consumed by the tree itself. While any fungal creature can have their Vim extracted, Toad Vim is the most potent and easy to harvest. \n Like Prestige, the measure of Vim extracted from innocents is added to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_DESC_STRENGTH;Followers of this religion value glory in combat, force of arms, and manly deeds. Proving oneself as a ruler, including obeying the law one is enforcing and being strict and ruthless on those who break it, are also prized actions in some cultures and faiths, though not neccesarily as much as demonstrating one's power. The stronger a ruler is perceived to be, the more any applicable clergymen and the general public will respect and reverently fear him. Like Prestige, it is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_DESC_WISH;This indicator is not how many wishes a worshipper of the stars or moon can have granted, but rather, one's favor with the Star Spirits or other cosmic entity. It means nothing without a righteous soul and personality, but is nonetheless greatly respected by the clergy on this mortal coil. Like Prestige, it is added to one's score at the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_EVOLUTION;Evolutionary Gains;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_EVOLUTION;The Dinohattanites are nominally men, derived from dinosaurs over the eons. Evolution and the origin of life has always captivated them, and unlocking instaneous evolutionary mutations have provided the means of creating secret policemen- the False Goombas -that any Dinohattanite ruler can deploy if he possesses a De-Evolution Chamber. \n The more knowledge and understanding a Dinohattanite ruler has of evolution and de-evolution, the more power he wields. Like Prestige, one's understanding of evolution is added to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_MUSHROOM_KADABRA;Mushroom-Kadabra;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_MUSHROOM_KADABRA;Mushroom Kadabra is both an invocation in spells and the general term used for folk magic in the Mushroom World, particularly in the Dry Dry Desert. It is also used by the various genies known to inhabit the galaxy in the course of granting wishes and escourting righteous souls towards Power Stars. The antithesis of Mushroom-Kadabra are the curses of Fungus-Pocus. Like Prestige, harmonizing Mushroom-Kadabra contributes points to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

STAT_PIETY_FEAR;Fear;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_FEAR;To those who dabble in dark arts, holding to an outside enforcer's moralizing means nothing, and instead those who consider themselves pious practitioners count religious worth in how feared the magician in question is by those who do not understand the dark arts. Like Prestige, harnessing Fear contributes points to one's score upon the death of a ruler.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
